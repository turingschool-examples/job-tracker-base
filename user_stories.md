When I visit a specific job page,
I see the name of each of the tags associated with that job.
```

```txt
As a user,
When I visit a specific job page,
I also see a count of how many jobs have each specific tag listed.
```

```txt

When I visit a specific job page,
I also see an average salary for all jobs within each specific tag listed.
```
